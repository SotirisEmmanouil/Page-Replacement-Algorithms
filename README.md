# Page-Replacement-Algorithms

## This project implements 4 page replacement algorithms: 

<ul>
  <li>Least Recently Used</li>
  <li>First in First Out</li>
  <li>Second Chance</li>
  <li>Optimal</li>
  </ul>
  
 They are all implemented in their own respective methods. The methods take in a page reference string as 
 a parameter and then compute the total number of page faults. A side by side comparison is printed to the console comparing the total number of page faults between all the algorithms for each page reference string.
 
## Deliverables:

<ul>
  <li>The 4 algorithms implemented in their own respective methods</li>
  <li>A README file which contains instructions on how to run the program</li>
  <li>Fully documented code</li>
  <li>A pdf file containing a screenshot of the output</li>
  </ul>
