# Page-Replacement-Algorithms

## This project implements 4 page replacement algorithms: 

<ul>
  <li>Least Recently Used</li>
  <li>First in First Out</li>
  <li>Second Chance</li>
  <li>Optimal</li>
  </ul>
  
 They are all implemented in their own respective methods. The methods take in a page reference string as 
 a paremeter and then compute the number of page faults for each algorithm. A side by side comparison is printed comaparing the page faults between all algorithms
 
## Delivarables:

<ul>
  <li>The 4 algorithms implemented in their own respective methods</li>
  <li>A README file which contains instructions on how to run the program</li>
  <li>Fully documented code</li>
  </ul>
  
  This project was completed in the Spring 2023 semester while taking Dr. Md Mahbubur Rahman's CSCI340 "Operating Systems" course at 
  CUNY Queens College.
